# Image Trainer 

Simple app created to change images with exercises into training.

### How to use it 

1. Create folder with images of exercises
2. Sort files with lexical order in mind
3. Set duration of each exercises and repetition by suffixing a fine name with numbers divided with `;`. 
  Eg.`fine-name 10;60;60.ext` will be displayed for 10sec (with countdown and dong at the end) and then for 60sec and then for 60sec. You can set as many intervals as you want :D
4. Build/OrNot :D and open the app.
5. Select a folder with the training
6. Have fun
